    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Majoring in robotics and artificial intelligence at Waseda University and working as a research assistant in Ogata Lab.
      I have hands-on experience in developing hardware models by using Fusion 360 and am able to implement cutting edge deep learning models such as RNN, CNN, with attention mechanisms for robot manipulation.
      As a research assistant, I tackled challenging scenarios like creating end-effectors, enhanced multimodal learning models, and automated data collection processes using python.
      At university, I researched soft robots which generate complex behaviors and manipulated them by using deep learning algorithms.
