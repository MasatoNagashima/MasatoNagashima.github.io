    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Majoring in robotics, machine learning and deep learning at Ogata Lab, and working as a backend engineer in Knowns.

      At university, I am researching soft robots which generate complex behaviors and manipulated them by using deep learning algorithms. In addition, I have hands-on experience in developing hardware models in Fusion 360.

      As a backend engineer, I tackle with cloud maintenance and its operations. Especially, I am interested in data engineering which perform data managiment and data analysis through some machine learning algorithms. 
      
      Fortunately, my research environment is quite international even in Japan. This experience has improved my English skills as native Japanese speaker. After completing a master's degree, I want to work globaly as a backend enginner.
