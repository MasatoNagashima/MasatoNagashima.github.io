    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Majoring in robotics, machine learning and deep learning at Ogata Lab, and working as a backend engineer in Knowns.

      At university, I am researching soft robots which generate complex behaviors and manipulated them by using deep learning algorithms. In addition, I have hands-on experience in developing hardware models in Fusion 360.

      As a backend engineer, I tackle with cloud maintenance and its operations. Especially, I am interested in data engineering which optimize a performane of huge databese on web applications. 
      
      Fortunately, my research environment is quite international even in Japan. This experience has improved my English skills as native Japanese speaker. After completing a master's degree, I want to work globaly as a backend enginner.
